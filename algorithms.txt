Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

START
Take an input n
Initialize a variable sum_n with 0
Start a for loop with loop variable 'i' from 1 to n
Set sum_n = sum_n + i
[End loop]
Display sum_n
END


Problem 2: Check for Prime Number

START
Take input and store it in n
Start a for loop with variable 'i' from 2 to n//2
Divide n by 'i'
	If it's divisible, display "not a prime no."; exit the loop
	If it's not divisible, display "prime no."
[End loop]
END


Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers

START
Take three number inputs and store them in a, b, c
If a > b and a > c: Display "a is max"
Else if b > a and b > c: Display "b is max"
Else: Display "c is max"
END


Problem 4: Factorial Calculation

Take an input n
Initialize a variable fact_n with 1
Start a for loop with loop variable 'i' from 1 to n
Set fact_n = fact_n * i
[End loop]
Display fact_n
END


Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

START
Take input and store it in n
Divide n by 2
	If it's divisible, display "even"
	If it's not divisible, display "odd"
END
